# Sketchar
AR sketching app based on Unity's [AR Foundation](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.xr.arfoundation@4.2/manual/index.html) and my own [VR-Sketching-Geometry framework](https://github.com/tterpi/VRSketchingGeometry).  

The app currently features interaction using only touch gestures:
- tap and hold the screen and then move the device to draw
- swipe anywhere to delete the last drawn line
